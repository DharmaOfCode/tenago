# tenago
A Go API client and command line tool for Tenable.io

## Why?

1) To learn and practice Go
2) There a multiple questions that I cannot answer using the Tenable.io GUI alone. Because of that, this projects consists not just of the API alone but also a command utility that allows users to perform multiple queries that, with the UI interface alone, would require multiple manual steps. 

## Usage
Run the application without argument or use the `-h` flag to get usage information.
